Basic chess game.

What I've achieved from making chess:

1. Gave me clearer insights on creating algorithms especially with piece movements.

2. How to create chess board from a scratch using css and javascript with multidimensional-array.

3. Good review that "array === array" is always true and had to use string or number for comparison. 

4. Learned planning ahead of time may significantly reduce the workload, especially when the project gets bigger. (Need to work on planning ahead)



If coming back to this game in the future:

I would like to implement: selecting a piece highlights the moveable area and remove highlights when other piece are selected, pawn getting "knighted" and/or special move with king and rook.
